**Have you ever wanted your code roasted on a LaurieWired Youtube video?  Do you like Steins;Gate and think your personal captcha system outclasses decades of reverse-turing research? Do you also enjoy custom, low-quality prizes?  Here's your chance!**

## 🔮 Background

Kurisu Makise has reappeared from the year 2038 to your current worldline.  According to her, the only thing standing between CERN and total domination by their new AI system is...

A new kind of CAPTCHA.

Kurisu has turned to you, the future depends on your ingenuity.  The CAPTCHA must be difficult enough to baffle the AI, yet solvable by the average human.


## 🎯 Objective
Create a modern CAPTCHA system for the future.  Anything goes.

Use the programming language of your choice.

## 📜 Rules
- Your CAPTCHA *must* be solvable by a human in ~30 seconds or less.
- The code *must* compile to a valid binary.
- If I need to use a non-standard method to compile your code, call it out in the code comments.
- All supporting assets *must* be included in the zip file you give me.
- Call out how to execute the binary if unconventional.
- No Malware.


## 🕛 Deadline
Submissions will close at approximately 23:59 PST on Wednesday, October 16th 2024.

## 📥 How to Submit

All submissions must be sent as a public or private git repo.  If private, add LaurieWired as a collaborator.  Include the source code and a compiled + zipped *Windows* executable in the repo.  Submit via this form:

[Submit Form](https://forms.gle/nTY42PXvMxQtj1TCA)

The most interesting submissions will be featured in a special upcoming Halloween LaurieWired video.  Check last year's video for an example of the previous challenge: [Asuka Roasts Your Sorting Algorithms](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u0aoByec99Q)

## 🎁 Prize
All "finalists" (aka entries that get featured in the upcoming LaurieWired video) will recieve a special custom gift from LaurieWired, mailed to an address of their choosing.
